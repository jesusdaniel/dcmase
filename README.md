# Code for "Joint spectral clustering in multilayer degree corrected blockmodels" by Joshua Agterberg, Zachary Lubberts and Jesus Arroyo

This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the experiments and data analysis from the paper "Joint spectral clustering in multilayer degree corrected blockmodels". In particular, this code implements the degree-corrected multiple adjacency spectral embedding (DC-MASE) to perform community detection in multilayer networks.

## Overview

Given a collection of *L* adjacency matrices representing graphs with $n$ aligned vertices (e.g., multilayer networks), DC-MASE obtains a joint embedding matrix with n rows, where each row corresponds to a vertex in the networks. After this, communities are obtained by applying a clustering procedure (such as K-means) to partition the latent positions into K groups in order to estimate the memberships in the multilayer degree-corrected stochastic block model. 

The joint embedding is calculated by performing a separate *adjacency spectral embedding*  (ASE) for each graph, which consists in computing the eigendecomposition of each adjacency matrix, with a possible eigenvalue scaling, followed by a row-normalization step (such as dividing the rows by its L2 norm), and then performs a joint singular value decomposition of the concatenated row-normalized ASEs. A pictorial representation is presented below.

# Data
The networks encode weighted edges representing the monthly number of flights between pairs of US airports. These data were obtained from the [T-100 Segment (US Carriers Only)](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=GEE) database US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). A post-processed version of this dataset is included in this repository. The DC-MASE algorithm is illustrated using these data.

## Data Access

This project includes access to publicly available data.  The following datasets are openly accessible and included in this repository:

### **Available Dataset**
- **Name:** US airport network (2016-2021)
- **Format:** RData
- **Location:** `Data/US_airport_data.RData`
- **Description:** This dataset contains weighted adjacency matrices representing the monthly number of flights between US airports. The data was obtained from the T-100 Segment (US Carriers Only) database of the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).
- **Contents:**
  - `Adj_list`: A list of 69 adjacency matrices, where each matrix represents flights for a given month.
  - `airport_coordinates`: A 343×2 matrix with latitude and longitude of each airport (for visualization).
  - `airport_names`: A vector of airport codes matching the order in `Adj_list`.

Example code to load the data in R and fit 4 communities.

```{r}
source("R/dcmase.R")
source("R/comdet-dcmase.R")
source("R/SpectralMethods.R")
source("R/make_dcsbm_plots.R")

load("Data/US_airport_data.RData")

# Symmetrize networks (total number of flights between locations)
Adj_list <- lapply(Adj_list, function(A) ((A+t(A))))

# Fit a 4-community multilayer DCSBM
comdcmase.res <- comdet_dcmase(Adj_list, K = 4, clustering_method = "kmeans", scaled = T)

# Plot map with airports colored by community
plot_usmap(comdcmase.res$community_memberships)
