# Community detection on multilayer degree corrected stochastic block models via DC-MASE

The degree-corrected multiple adjacency spectral embedding (DC-MASE) obtains a joint embedding from multilayer network data to estimate community memberships in the multilayer degree-corrected stochastic blockmodel (DC-SBM).
